# fdrci: FDR selection and adjustment - HGSOC
# Joshua Millstein
# 10/17/2022
# Introduction
# 
# In the context of high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), we might be
# interested in more fully understanding the relationship between age, cancer
# stage and gene expression in tumor tissue. These questions could be addressed
# in data hosted by Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and collected as part of our
# study (Millstein et al. 2020) involving 513 gene expression features measured
# in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue from 3,769 women with
# HGSOC.
# 
# Gene expression is often approximately normally distributed in population
# data, so it would make sense to apply linear regression in a separate model
# for each gene, where expression is the outcome and age and stage are the
# predictors. If we are interested in the question of whether there is effect
# modification, for example, if the effect of stage on expression varies across
# different age groups, we could include an interaction term between age and
# stage. A p-value for the interaction could be computed for each gene using an
# F-test, and multiplicity in testing could be address by computing FDR, such
# as the Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) approach (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995).
# 
# However, we might be concerned about the assumption of normality of error,
# and with many genes, this is could be hard to verify. To avoid this
# assumption, we can take a non-parametric permutation-based approach
# (Millstein and Volfson 2013) by randomly permuting the age*stage product term
# to generate sets of results distributed approximately under the null
# hypothesis. The fdrci R package, which includes an approach to account for
# multiplicity in FDR CIs (Millstein et al. 2022), could then be applied.
# 
# Essentially, the investigator chooses a series of possible discovery
# thresholds, and at each threshold FDR is computed along with a p-value that
# tests H0:FDR=1 against the alternative, H1:FDR<1. The Benjamini and Yekutieli
# (BY) approach (Benjamini and Yekutieli 2005) via the BH approach is used to
# select thresholds corresponding to rejected null hypotheses and to adjust
# selected FDR CIs for multiplicity. Thus, the investigator is free to choose
# post hoc from any one (or multiple) of the selected discovery thresholds
# while maintaining adequate control of FDR CI coverage.

# Organization
# 
#     Download HGSOC data from GEO
#     Conduct analysis of effect modification between age and stage
#     Generate multiple replicates of results under the null by permutation
#     Compute FDR using the fdrci package with the “BH” option to account for multiplicity

# package GEOquery to get the Nanostring panel of gene expression features as
# well as some limited patient information including age group (based on
# quartiles of the training dataset with groups aged <53, 53-59, 60-66, and
# >=67), stage (dichotomized into early (FIGO stage I/II) and advanced (FIGO
# stage III/IV)).

# Compute BH FDR
# 
# We can use the p.adjust() function to compute a q-value, which essentially
# treats each p-value as a discovery threshold for FDR (Storey and Tibshirani
# 2003). Typically, a priori values such as 0.05 or 0.1 are then used to
# determine which q-values correspond to false null hypotheses, here, genes
# that should be considered discoveries. We see that no genes meet q < 0.05 but
# two genes meet the q < 0.1 level.

# Parametic approach: BH FDR < 0.1 gene 	p_value 	q_value
# IGFBP4 	3e-04 	0.0884
# CAV1 	1e-04 	0.0705
# 
# This result raises a troubling issue for this more conventional approach. The
# investigator will not know a priori which threshold, 0.1 or 0.05, is more
# appropriate, yet to be formally correct they need to choose before the
# analysis is conducted. If they are lucky enough to choose 0.1, the results
# yield two significant genes, however, if they happen to choose 0.05, then
# they must conclude that there are no discoveries. This highlights an
# important motivation for the proposed approach, which allows the investigator
# to choose the discovery threshold post hoc.
# 
# Repeatly conduct analysis following permutation
# 
# Another motivation for the proposed approach is it’s non-parametric
# construction, which allows the investigator to relax distributional
# assumptions. Rather than evaluate the observed results against a parametric
# distribution, we approximate the distribution under the null hypothesis using
# the data itself.
# 
# Here the null hypothesis is that the age-stage interaction term is
# independent of gene expression conditional on the covariates site, age, and
# stage. Below, we generate p-values consistent with this null by randomly
# permuting the ageStage interation term. Thus, 100 sets of results distributed
# approximately under the null are generated.

# Compute FDR using the fdrci package
# 
# To use the fdrci package to compute FDR, the investigator must provide
# candidate discovery thresholds. In this case the test statistic is the
# p-value itself, and we choose values that correspond to the series,
# −log10(p)=2,2.1,2.2,...,5 . Each row of the output table includes the
# permutation-based FDR estimate, 95% CIs, π0, over-dispersion estimate,
# number of discoveries in the observed data, and total number of discoveries
# in the permuted data (summed over all permutation results). First we will
# estimate FDR and 95% CIs without accounting for multiplicity
# 
# We see that for all of our candidate discovery thresholds the upper FDR CI
# bound is less than one, indicating evidence of true alternative hypotheses
# within all of these sets. However, note that there is only one test
# corresponding to FDR<0.1. If all parametric assumptions are satisfied this
# approach should be less conservative than BH FDR. The fact that it is more
# conservative here may indicated mild departures from parametric assumptions.
# 
# We are still faced with the issue of selecting one or more FDR CIs without
# accounting for the selection process. Thus, we recompute using the “BH”
# option.

# Why is there no difference between the adjusted and unadjusted results?
# 
# The proposed selection and adjustment approach relies on the BH method in
# selection of discovery threshold FDR confidence intervals. Recall that one of
# the properties of the BH approach is that if all p-values are less than the
# target type I error, , then the adjusted significance level is the same as
# the unadjusted level. We are observing this dynamic here. That is, all
# candidate thresholds have sufficient evidence of FDR<1
# 
# to justify selection, thus there is no adjustment in this case.
# 
# Final thoughts
# 
# If we look at violin plots of expression of the most significant gene,
# Caveolin-1 (CAV1), against age and stage groups, we see clear differences by
# stage, with expression in stage = 1 tumors lower than expression in stage = 2
# tumors. However, there is also a suggestion of trends with age that appears
# to reverse across stage groups. For stage = 1 tumors, expression tends to
# decrease with age, whereas for stage = 2 tumors, expression tends to increase
# with age.
